##Find Weather App

The FindWeather app is built using Python, Flask, and the OpenWeatherMap API. 
Python is a widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python that allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily. The OpenWeatherMap API is a free weather data API that provides current weather data and forecasts for cities around the world.

##Architecture
The architecture of the Flask weather app is simple. The app uses Flask to serve web pages and handle user requests. The backend code uses Python to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and process it before sending it to the frontend. HTML and CSS are used to create the frontend of the app, which allows users to input a location and receive current weather data.

##Process
The process for building the Flask weather app involved several steps. First, I researched the OpenWeatherMap API and its documentation to understand how to use it to fetch weather data. Next, I created a basic Flask app and built out the frontend using HTML and CSS. Finally, I integrated the API with the Flask app to fetch and display weather data.

As a solo developer, there was no collaboration involved in this project. The timeline for the project was about two weeks, with most of the time spent on research and frontend development.

##Challenge(s) overcome
One of the main challenges of building the Flask weather app was parsing the JSON response from the OpenWeatherMap API and extracting the relevant weather data. I had to carefully read the API documentation and experiment with different Python libraries to find the best way to handle the JSON data.

Another challenge was integrating the API with the Flask app and passing the weather data from the backend to the frontend. We had to learn how to use Flask's render_template() function to dynamically render the HTML and display the weather data.

##Learnings as a result of this project
Building the FindWeather app taught me several technical skills, including working with APIs, parsing JSON data, and integrating frontend and backend code. I also gained experience using Flask.
